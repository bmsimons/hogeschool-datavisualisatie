# Data visualization Application

This is the repository for Project 3 of year one at the University Of Applied Sciences.
The goal of the project is to create a application which visualizes datasets. 
For this project we chose an interesting and uncommon tech stack. We create the 'back-end' data parser and aggregator in .NET (which was mandatory).
As for the 'front-end' application we chose for Electron. The database we use is MongoDB.

# Project definition

For our project we need to do the following:

- Visualization of data in data sets.
- Parsing data from data sets.
- Storing parsed data in a database.
- Defining correlations between multiple datasets.
- Visualize answers to the questions of our product owner.
